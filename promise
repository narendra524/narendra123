Promise:
A promise is a special javascript object that represent eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous Operation
1.Three states
1.pending:the initial state , the promises is still waiting for the operation to finish
2.Fulfilled:the operation completed successfully
3.Rejected:the operation failed

Exp:
To create a promise new promise();
the promises constructor takes a function with two parameters:
resolve--to mark as the  promise is successful
reject--to mark is as failed

Handling:
then () method is called when the promise is fulfilled
it receives the result from the resolve();
.catch()method is called when promise is rejected;
It receives the result from the reject();


EX:
let myPromise=new promise((resolve, reject)=>{
let success=true
if(success){
resolve("The Operation was successfully")
}else{
reject()
}
});
mypromise
.then(result=>{
console.log(result)
})            
.catch(error=>{
console.log(error)
})

op:
The operation was successfully                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

1.promises with setTimeout:
using settimeout the promises will resolve after the certain amount of time
function delayWithCondition(ms, condition) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (condition) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(`Resolved after ${ms}ms because the condition was true`);
      }, ms);
    } else {
      reject(`Rejected immediately because the condition was false`);
    }
  });
}

// Usage
let delayTime = 2000; let shouldResolve = true;
delayWithCondition(delayTime, shouldResolve)
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message);   })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); 
  });
